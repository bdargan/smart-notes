# Secondbrain system
Experiment with Secondbrain and Zettelkasten, the smart note taking system.
## Essentials: Note taking process
1. write your own notes to deeply internalize the subject matter (or trash)
2. [transient reading inbox](./reading/inbox.reading.md)
3. [writing inbox](./writing/inbox.writing.md)
4. lists, long form articles, web clips, annotations, book reviews, quotes, puzzles/open questions *(slip-box)*
5. daily notes / work log / journal

See https://notes.andymatuschak.org and work hard to *"Close the loop"*.

## Rules
* 1 inbox for all, or 1 for personal, professional, business...
* automate/determine rules for *closing the loop*: 
  * TODO: what mechanism will automatically close loops and show recent closed / trashed items
  * reading inbox
  * writing inbox
