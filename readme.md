# Secondbrain system
Experiment with Secondbrain and Zettelkasten, the smart note taking system. Based on Foam with modifications to support my workflow with a [PARA folder structure](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) twist.
## Essentials: Note taking process
1. write your own notes to deeply internalize the subject matter (or trash)
2. [transient reading inbox](./inbox/inbox.reading.md)
3. [writing inbox](./writing/inbox.writing.md)
4. notes are formed and put into the *slip-box*, into succinct, well connected notes, or lists, or long form articles,or  web clips, or annotated content, or book reviews,or  quotes, or puzzles/open questions
5. daily notes, or work log or journal

All of the above you can do yourself with Foam. I'm experimenting with how I can improve on this in two ways:
1. What process and/or features will assist me in *[Closing the loop](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Close_open_loops)* - *because I regularly fail at this*
2. What feature changes can I make to keep focus on the PARA organized folders?
  - For example, should some extensions for foam ignore the archive folder to let me focus on the more relevant and actionable folders?
