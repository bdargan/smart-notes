# PARA Organize notes by actionability
> Tiago Forte developed a system called PARA. Those letters stand for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. The essential idea is to organize notes by actionability.

If you look at the four categories, they’re actually a spectrum of actionability

**Projects are your most actionable things.** Like things, you’re working on right now, they usually have a deadline, they have a scope there, they’re really active.

**The second one is Areas of responsibility.** Things you’re responsible for. Things you need to pay attention to, or have some level of engagement with, but that are not as urgent.

**R stands for resources.** It is basically just like interests or things you’re kind of interested in. For example, web design, or Visual Thinking or big data, or coding or something like that.

**Archives** the last category is simply anything from the other three categories that is no longer active.

The benefit of organizing things by actionability is you can decide really instantaneously how actionable something is.
