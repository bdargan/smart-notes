# Writing Inbox
> temporary location for writing better notes, connecting them to form
> When notes are good enough to be permanent, they must move into appropriate PARA organisation.

TODO: My writing steps need to be adapted for my work challenges, outputs and outcomes.

## Original writing steps from 2.1 Writing a paper
1. write fleeting notes
2. Make reference notes (literature notes)
3. Make permanent notes - *ideally once per day*
   - the idea is not to collect, but to develop (understanding) ideas, arguments, discussions
   - Similarities and differences with other notes?
   - does the new information contradict, correct, support, add, or supersede what i already have
   - Can you combine ideas to generate something new?
   - What questions are triggered by them?
   - Make notes as if for someone else (actually will be your future self), with full sentences, references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible
   - Throw away the fleeting notes from step 1.
4. Add permanent notes to slip-box
   - add to folder
   - link with other notes
   - add tags
     - how you would retrieve this
5. Develop your topics, questions and research from the bottom up
6. Look for the emergent ideas to select a topic
7. Create an outline, then a rough draft
8. Edit and proofread
9.
